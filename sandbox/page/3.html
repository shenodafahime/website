  <p>Shepherd is a platform for business owners to build communities and peer groups so they can better face the challenges and opportunities they share (launching soon!). I designed the brand with supervision from Shepherd&#39;s lead, Ben. The main logo depicts two crossed shepherd crooks forming an S.</p>
  <p>The alternate logo is a dog, an Australian shepherd. Shepherds still use dogs to herd and control their flocks. Dogs are a great symbol of companionship and loyalty, qualities central to Shepherd. Herding breeds like the Aussie and border collie are the smartest.</p>
  <p>Erin loves Aussies. Even as her husband, I&#39;ll always be second place in her heart, behind her family Aussie, Tess. She was thrilled to find my screen like this:</p>
  <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N7OuNQS.jpg" alt="Aussie desktop"></p>
  <p>Designing an Aussie logo was a fun challenge. Blue merle Aussies have striking coloring, with gray and black patchwork  and tan points. My solution was to stylize the whole image: use a striped pattern for the patches, punch up the colors to blue and gold, and stick to an angular grid. It&#39;s a dog you won&#39;t forget.</p>

<p>After shipping <a href="/blog/flickity-v2-released">Flickity v2</a> thus wrapping 2016&#39;s huge development project, I didn&#39;t have it in me to write another line of code. I discussed my state of mind and motivation in this 3 min podcast.</p>

<p>Looking to change things up, I started making logos. </p>
<p>Man, I love logos. A little piece of imagery that represents the ideal you want your project to be â€” that&#39;s design magic right there. I&#39;ve been able to work on some great logo projects, but I&#39;ve been itching to do more. Rather than wait for projects to come my way, I gave myself a project of my own: design 50 logos. <strong>50 logos in 30 days.</strong></p>
<p>Fifty logos is a lot. At least one or two a day for an entire month. I tried pushing myself: exploring different styles, subjects, and techniques. It was like design boot camp: working all those muscles you never use.</p>
